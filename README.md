## Hi there! :ghost:

I am a Computational Science and Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano and EPFL Lausanne.

My studies are focused on Numerical Analysis and Partial Differential Equations (mainly applied to Fluid-Dynamics problems), but sometimes life is hard and I have to get out of my fantasy world made of ðŸ’ž Functional Analysis proofs ðŸ’ž and do some Machine Learning.

:mortar_board: **Education:**
 - Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano` and `EPFL`
 - Alta Scuola Politecnica (Politecnico di Milano Honor Program)
 - Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`
